# Collatz_Conjecture_Graph_Steps

This is my <i>first GitHub project</i>, and I saw a video by Veritasium about the Collatz Conjecture, so I wanted to write a Python program that calculates the steps it takes for a number to reach 1 using the Collatz Conjecture rules.

You start with any positve integer (the "Original" number). Check if it is even or odd.

<code>If the Original is odd, you multiply it by 3 first and then add 1 to it to give you the next number.
If the Original is even, you divide it by 2 to give you the next number.</code>

You continue this process for this next number and eventually it seems you should end back down at 1. 

For example, the Original using 2, we will divide by 2 to give you 1, and this took 1 step.
The Original using 3, we will multiply by 3 and add 1, it will yield 10, and it goes down to 5 by halving. Then, it goes to 16, and then 8, and then 4 and 2 and 1.

Run this program to see how your Original differs and how many steps it takes.
Check the screenshot for an example!

<strong>Also, I added a plot graph if you want to see the steps your Original number takes while it is operated throughout the program.</strong>

Let me know where I can improve.

Thank you!
